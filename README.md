# Predictive Modeling for Loan Default Risk Assessment: Leveraging Logistic Regression and Data-Driven Insights

## Description
This project aims to build a predictive model to forecast loan defaults using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains information about borrowers and their loans, which is used to train a logistic regression model to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan.


## Dataset


The dataset used in this project is a dataset with 255,347 entries and 18 columns. Each row represents a borrower with various attributes such as age, income, loan amount, credit score, and other related features.
## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

1. Reading the Data: The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Dropping Unnecessary Columns: The LoanID column is dropped as it does not provide useful information for prediction.
3. Checking Data Types and Missing Values: The data types of each column are checked, and missing values are handled.
4. Categorical Data Inspection: The categorical columns are inspected to understand their distributions.
5. Label Encoding: Categorical columns are converted into numerical data using Label Encoding.
## Feature Engineering

- Correlation Analysis: The correlation between features and the target variable (Default) is analyzed.
- Multicollinearity Check: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is calculated to check for multicollinearity among features.
- Data Balancing: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to balance the dataset.
- Outlier Removal: Isolation Forest is used to remove outliers from the data.
## Model Building and Evaluation

1. Model Selection: Logistic regression is used as the predictive model.
2. Model Training: The model is trained on the preprocessed data.
3. Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A classification report is generated.
## Results

- Accuracy: 73.55%
- Precision: 76.25%
- Recall: 74.04%
- F1-Score: 75.13%


The model effectively predicts loan defaults, providing valuable insights into risk factors and aiding in better financial decision-making.
## Conclusion

The logistic regression model developed in this project demonstrates a reasonable performance in predicting loan defaults. Significant features impacting loan defaults include age, interest rate, and the presence of a co-signer.
